### Install dependencies 
Execute the following lines in your Ubuntu environment: 
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install autoconf
sudo apt-get install subversion
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev
sudo apt-get install libnetcdf-dev
sudo apt-get install gawk
Lastly, you need proj.4. This is special, and you need to do the following in the Ubuntu environment: 
    wget http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-5.2.0.tar.gz
    mkdir ~/proj
    mv proj-5.2.0.tar.gz ~/proj/
    cd proj
    tar -zxvf proj-5.2.0.tar.gz
    cd proj-5.2.0
    sudo ./configure
    sudo make
    sudo make install
Optional, you should also get vim for opening/editing text files:
sudo apt-get install vim (optional)

### Installation of atlantis
To get the most up-to-date version of the atlantis-trunk from CSIRO, you need to enter the following in the Ubuntu environment:
svn co https://svnserv.csiro.au/svn/ext/atlantis/Atlantis/trunk/atlantis
To get a specific version (e.g., 6665), you need to enter the following in the Ubuntu environment:
svn co -r 6665 https://svnserv.csiro.au/svn/ext/atlantis/Atlantis/trunk/atlantis
Now, atlantisMerged needs to be built. To do that, you need to execute the following in the Ubuntu environment (The following steps are a merger of steps from Javier and the wiki):
mkdir [some folder where you will keep your versions of atlantis code, e.g. AtlantisTrunks]
cd [some folder where you will keep your versions of atlantis code, e.g. AtlantisTrunks]
aclocal
autoheader
autoconf
automake -a # may have warnings 
autoreconf -fvi # fix some links
./configure
sudo make CFLAGS='-Wno-misleading-indentation -Wno-format -Wno-implicit-fallthrough'  
sudo make install

May need to open and edit PreRules.am file and edit WARN lines appropriately
When checking atlantisMerged; if you get a ‘error while loading shared libraries’ message, run line:
sudo ldconfig
      And then re-run 
Check the executable by going into the atlantismain folder and entering the following into the Ubuntu environment
./atlantisMerged

Make a virtual link to the build exe in the folder with inputs. First, go to the directory with your inputs and type the following into the Ubuntu environment:
ln -sf [location of atlantisMerged] [name of model-link]
